This project features my website that displays all my digital artwork . This website helps me connect with people who like my artwork and gives them an opportunity to browse through my collections for free. They can also easily contact me with the click of a button.

In this project I have created my website using HTML,CSS and JavaScript ; used Bootsrap for a responsive design and then uploaded my code on Github. Then I used Azure Static Apps to link the GitHub repository that had my website and created a workflow that would deploy the static app. The Static App hosts the website on Azure. The steps for creating a static app were as follows : 

1) Firstly , I created a Resource 
2)Then I went to Azure Marketplace and selected Static Apps 
3)On The Basics Tab , I chose my Subscription and Resource Group , stated a name for it , selected my hosting plan. 
4) On Deployment details , I linked my Github account and selected the organization,repository and the branch that had my website. 
5) Then I set my tags and went to Review+Create Tab. There , I started the deployment process. 
6) After Deployment was done , a workflow was automatically added to the github repo that allowed the static app to function as hosting my website. 
7) The link displayed in the Overview Tab of my Static App works as the website's URL
